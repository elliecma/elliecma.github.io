# Headache Tracking

I have had chronic migraine since November 2016 and I started tracking my headaches in January 2018. I use an app called "Life" that has many other categories for tracking such as exercise, mood, nutrition, etc. For headaches, I use the "Symptom" and "Medication" categories. This app allows you to export entries to a CSV, so I have chosen to use this data to practice cleaning and visualizing data for my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

The purpose of this project is: To see how my headaches have changed over time

I took a break from work in February 2022 to focus on migraine treatment, so in particular one question is: Have my headaches gotten better since February 2022?

But... what does "gotten better" mean?

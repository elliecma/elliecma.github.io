# Popular Names in the US

After completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate, I wanted to explore gathering and analyzing data in BigQuery as well as visualizing data in Tableau. 
I am using the "usa_names" dataset on BigQuery to explore the most popular names in the US.
I exported my results to CSVs to import into Tableau and embedded the visualizations in my Kaggle notebook found here: [USA Names](https://www.kaggle.com/code/elliecd/usa-names)

# Wedding Invitations

This was a pitch deck I put together to show my soon-to-be-husband to see if he would be on board for upping our budget for wedding invitations.

My husband and I met at a concert and we love seeing live music together, so we decided to incorporate our favorite elements of music festivals into our wedding. We booked a venue where everyone could stay on the property for the whole weekend, creating a Coachella-camping-like atmosphere where you could run into your friends and family all weekend. We also hired an amazing live band that kept the dance party going all night (they even played at the afterparty!). To get everyone hyped for the event, I wanted to design our invitations such that the recipients really felt like they were headed to a festival weekend.

Before I ordered any pieces of the invitations, I wanted to do some mockups and get pricing quotes to see what the total cost was going to be. As I worked on this I got more and more excited at the prospect of having our guests open up their packages to not just the invitations, but custom festival wristbands, maps of the "festival" (wedding) grounds, and some swag. I made my husband wait until I had all the mockups complete so he could see it altogether. He was the first test case! After going through each mockup and what they potentially might look like, I finally divulged the price breakdown. It was a smidge (3x) our planned budget for invitations, but my hope was that by the time we got to the pricing he would be convinced it was worth the money. Well, it worked like a charm! We worked together to make a few adjustments and figure out exactly what we wanted, then I got to ordering. See below for the pitch deck that I used:

My husband's and my "couple name" is Chellie - so we obviously named our wedding festival Coachellie. See below for the final product including invitation cards, custom map of our venue, wristbands, sticker, magnet, temporary tattoos, and even a QR code to seal the envelope that linked to a Spotify playist we made!
